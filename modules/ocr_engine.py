Feature 10 — OCR Text Extraction.

Uses PaddleOCR if it is installed and its models are available (PaddleOCR
downloads its recognition/detection models ONCE on first use, into a local
cache folder — no admin rights are required for `pip install paddleocr`,
since pip installs into the user's own Python environment; after that
first model download, PaddleOCR runs fully offline).

If PaddleOCR is not installed, or its models are not cached and cannot be
fetched (e.g. no network available on this machine), we automatically and
silently fall back to Tesseract (pytesseract), which is already offline,
lightweight, and available. This guarantees the app keeps working
regardless of what's installed on a given Windows/macOS machine.

Only ever OCRs the banner image that is handed to it — never the full
email — per spec (item 10 & 8).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Headline vs Subheadline splitting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banners commonly stack a large-font Headline directly above a smaller-font
Subheadline (see e.g. "DOMINATE EVERYDAY. YOUR WAY." / "DRIVE YOUR MATCH.").
A flat joined text string has no notion of which words belonged to which
line, so a single blob comparison can't reliably tell headline text apart
from subheadline text.

To fix this, `extract_lines()` returns each OCR detection as a `TextLine`
that keeps its text AND its pixel height (bounding-box height) and vertical
position. `cluster_lines_by_size()` then groups those lines into "large"
(headline-sized) and "small" (subheadline-sized) clusters using relative
font height — the tallest line-height band on the banner is treated as the
Headline band, and the next-tallest distinct band as the Subheadline band.
Everything else (dealer name, disclaimers, CTAs, logos-as-text, etc.) is
left as "other" and is still available via the full joined text.

`extract_text()` is kept as-is (flat joined string) for backward
compatibility with callers that only need the whole banner text (e.g. the
OCR QA tab, dealer-in-banner substring check) — nothing about its
behaviour changed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line hygiene: logo/graphic noise must not corrupt a line's font height
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tesseract groups words into lines using its own block/paragraph/line
numbering, and it happily puts a NON-TEXT element into a text line when
the two sit on the same baseline. A real, observed case: a banner with the
BMW roundel logo immediately to the left of the headline OCR'd as

    'oD) ENGINEERED TO DELIVER OPTIMAL'   (conf 24 on 'oD)')

where the junk 'oD)' token's bounding box was 75px tall against 22-23px
for the real words. Because the old code took the line's height as
`max(bottom) - min(top)` across every word in the group, that one junk
token tripled the measured font height of the headline line — which then
threw the whole font-size banding off: the headline's two visual lines
landed in two different bands, and the dealer name got promoted into the
Subheadline (or even Headline) band. Every downstream comparison then
failed on a banner that was actually completely correct.

Both problems are fixed at the source in `_lines_with_tesseract()`:
  1. Words below `MIN_WORD_CONFIDENCE` are dropped (real banner copy OCRs
     at 80-96; logo/icon debris comes back in the 0-35 range).
  2. Words whose box height is a wild outlier against the MEDIAN word
     height of their own line are dropped, so a tall graphic glued onto a
     line can never define that line's font size.
Both filters are self-limiting: if applying one would empty a line
entirely, the line is kept unfiltered, so genuinely low-contrast banner
copy is never silently discarded. PaddleOCR/RapidOCR return line-level
boxes with their own confidence scores, so they get the equivalent
confidence guard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content-aware field assignment (`assign_lines_by_content`)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Font-size banding is a heuristic, and no heuristic survives every banner:
a dealer name set at 22px directly under a 23px headline line is within
any sane jitter tolerance, so geometry alone WILL merge them. The same
reasoning that produced `find_dealer_line()` (match by content, not by
pixels) applies just as well to Headline and Subheadline: whenever the
expected values are known — and in this app they always are, since they
come from the Master JPG/PDF/HTML or Manual Text — each OCR'd line can be
assigned to whichever field its words actually belong to.

`assign_lines_by_content()` does exactly that, and is deliberately
conservative: a line is only assigned when a strong majority of its own
words belong to that field's expected text, so a genuinely WRONG line on
the banner matches nothing and is reported as unmatched rather than being
quietly absorbed into a field it doesn't belong to. Callers fall back to
the geometric bands whenever content assignment finds nothing for a field,
so behaviour is never worse than before.

    Why this exists
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    The expected Headline is OCR'd from the Master creative and the found
    text is OCR'd from the dealer's email — two different renderings of the
    SAME artwork. Tesseract does not always break tightly-tracked display
    type at the same place in both:

        Master creative : "THEI7"  "BAYERISCHE" "MOTOREN" "WERKE"
        Dealer email    : "THE" "I7" "BAYERISCHE" "MOTOREN" "WERKE"

    Plain bag-of-words comparison sees zero overlap on the first token, so
    a pixel-perfect banner was reported as `Missing word(s): THEI7` and the
    line was not even attributed to the Headline field. The same happens in
    reverse with "ALL-IN,NO" vs "ALL-IN, NO".

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Why it is still strict
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A token is only ever reconciled when the characters account for each
    other EXACTLY and the tokens involved are CONSECUTIVE — "THE" + "I7"
    == "THEI7" is accepted; "NO" being a substring of "NOTHING" is not.
    Nothing is matched on partial or fuzzy grounds, so a genuinely wrong
    word is still reported as missing.

    Three passes, in decreasing strength:
      1. exact token matches (each found token consumed at most once)
      2. split:  one expected token == 2+ consecutive unused found tokens
      3. merge:  one found token == 2+ consecutive unused expected tokens

    `cluster_lines_by_size()` groups lines purely by relative font
    height. That works well for Headline vs Subheadline (which are
    usually a clearly different size), but real banners frequently
    render the Subheadline and Dealer Name at THE SAME size (e.g. a
    banner reading "BMW FUEL ADDITIVES." directly above "Bavaria
    Motors" at matching 17px OCR'd heights) — two genuinely different
    lines that height-only clustering cannot tell apart, so they get
    merged into a single band and the Dealer Name is lost.

    A pixel-geometry fix (e.g. "look for an unusually large vertical
    gap within a same-height group") was tried and rejected: real
    banners don't have a consistent gap-to-height ratio that reliably
    separates "a wrapped second line of the same block of copy" from
    "a new, distinct element below it" — the ratio for a genuine
    wrapped line on one banner can be numerically closer to the ratio
    for a genuine new-element break on another banner than either is
    to its own category. Any single threshold ends up right for some
    banners and wrong for others.

    Content matching sidesteps the geometry problem entirely: whenever
    an expected Dealer Name is available (dropdown / Manual Text /
    Excel), we already know what we're looking for, so we search for
    it directly by matching tokens rather than guessing from pixel
    size/position. This is strictly additive — it only ever "finds" a
    line when there's real word-level evidence for it, so a banner
    with no dealer name rendered at all correctly returns None instead
    of guessing.

    Matching is bidirectional (checked both ways):
      - most of the expected dealer name's own words must appear in
        the candidate line (so a line missing key dealer-name words
        doesn't match), AND
      - most of the candidate line's words must belong to the dealer
        name (so a long, unrelated line that merely happens to
        contain one shared word — e.g. a stray "BMW" — doesn't match).
    Both directions use the same `min_ratio` (default 0.7, matching
    the token-overlap fallback ratio already used elsewhere in this
    codebase for dealer-name matching, e.g. dealer_select.py).

    If more than one line meets the threshold, the single BEST-matching
    line (highest combined overlap ratio) is returned — real banners
    have at most one dealer-name line, so ties are broken toward the
    strongest match rather than the first/last positionally.

    `expected_dealer_name` may be a single name or a sequence of candidate
    names (see `_as_name_list()`); use `find_dealer_line_with_name()` when
    you also need to know which candidate matched.

    banding cannot separate lines that are genuinely the same measured

    that is completely correct. Because this app always knows what the
    fields are supposed to contain (Master JPG/PDF/HTML or Manual Text),
    matching on content sidesteps the measurement problem entirely.

    Deliberately conservative, so QA stays honest:
      - A line is assigned only when at least `min_line_ratio` of the
        LINE's own words appear in that field's expected text. A line whose
        copy is genuinely wrong therefore matches nothing, lands in
        `unmatched_lines`, and is reported — never silently absorbed into a
        field so that the field appears to pass.
      - Each line goes to its single best-scoring field, so a word shared
        between two expected values (e.g. "BMW" appearing in both) cannot
        drag a line into the wrong field.
      - Dealer name is resolved first and bidirectionally (via
        `find_dealer_line_with_name()`), since it is the strongest signal.

# RapidOCR — a last-resort engine that needs nothing outside pip
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `pip install pytesseract` only installs a WRAPPER; Tesseract itself is a
# system binary that has to be installed separately. On a machine where
# nobody ran that installer, and where PaddleOCR is also absent, every OCR
# call raised and both extract_text() and extract_lines() returned nothing
# at all. Because the banner headline exists only as pixels, that meant
# Headline / Subheadline / Dealer Name came back empty and Banner Text QA
# silently reported "No expected value provided for this field" - the
# user could not tell a blank banner apart from a missing OCR engine.
#
# RapidOCR ships its ONNX models inside the wheel and runs on onnxruntime,
# so `pip install rapidocr-onnxruntime` is genuinely all that is needed:
# no admin rights, no system package, no model download.
#
# IMPORTANT - this is ONLY an engine. It is reached exclusively when both
# PaddleOCR and Tesseract have already failed, i.e. on the exact code path
# that previously produced an empty result. The line clustering
# (cluster_lines_by_size / extract_clustered_text) is untouched, so on any
# machine where Tesseract works, behaviour is bit-for-bit what it was.
#
# Caveat worth knowing: RapidOCR tends to merge words on tightly-tracked
# display type ("BavariaMotors" for "Bavaria Motors"), which Tesseract
# handles correctly. Callers can detect this via `engine_used` and relax
# their word comparison accordingly. Tesseract remains the recommended
# engine and is preferred whenever it is present.

    Groups OCR'd lines into Headline (largest font band), Subheadline
    (next distinct, smaller font band), and Dealer Name / Other (any
    remaining, smaller bands) — purely from relative line height, no
    dependency on absolute pixel size, so it works whether the banner was
    cropped/scaled to any resolution.

    A fixed percentage threshold for "is this a new band?" doesn't work
    across different banners — some banners have a huge Headline vs
    Subheadline size difference and a small Subheadline vs Dealer Name
    difference, others are closer to uniform across all three, or even
    collapse Headline+Subheadline into nearly the same size on a
    different banner design. A single cutoff percentage is always wrong
    for some real banner somewhere.

    Instead, this uses a "biggest relative gap" cut-point approach that
    adapts to whatever size differences actually exist on THIS banner:
      1. Merge lines whose heights are within `jitter_tolerance_ratio`
         (default 8%) OR within `JITTER_TOLERANCE_MIN_PX` pixels of each
         other into the same "distinct size" group first — this absorbs
         pure OCR measurement noise between two lines that are visually
         the same font size (e.g. a wrapped 2-line Headline), without
         conflating genuinely different sizes. Line heights arrive here
         from `_core_line_height()`, which measures the smallest word box
         on the line rather than the line's overall extent — without that,
         a single apostrophe was enough to make one visual line of a
         headline measure 74% taller than the line above it and land in a
         different band.
      2. Take the resulting distinct size groups, sorted largest to
         smallest, and compute the proportional gap between each
         consecutive pair.
      3. Cut at the two BIGGEST gaps (if there are 3+ distinct size
         groups) to form up to 3 bands: Headline / Subheadline / Dealer
         Name. If there are only 2 distinct sizes, one gap is cut,
         forming Headline / Subheadline (Dealer Name band stays empty).
         If there's only 1 distinct size, everything is Headline.
      This way the split always lands on the biggest actual size jump on
      THIS banner, rather than requiring that jump to exceed some fixed
      percentage that may not match every banner's proportions.

    Band 1 = Headline, Band 2 = Subheadline, Band 3 (if present) =
    Dealer Name / Other.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    `expected_dealer_name` — content-aware dealer-line correction
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    Font-size geometry alone cannot always separate Subheadline from
    Dealer Name: real banners commonly render both at THE SAME size
    (e.g. "BMW FUEL ADDITIVES." directly above "Bavaria Motors" at
    matching OCR'd heights), so height-only clustering merges them into
    one band and no dedicated Dealer Name band ever forms.

    When `expected_dealer_name` is supplied (non-empty), this runs
    `find_dealer_line()` across ALL OCR'd lines — regardless of which
    band they landed in — looking for a line whose words strongly match
    the expected name. If a confident match is found, that exact line
    is moved out of whichever band it was sitting in (so it never also
    pollutes Headline/Subheadline text) and recorded on
    `clustered.dealer_line`. This is purely additive/corrective: if no
    confident content match is found (e.g. no dealer name is actually
    shown on this banner), the original geometric bands are returned
    completely unchanged, so a banner without a dealer name never gets
    a false dealer line invented for it, and existing behaviour when no
    `expected_dealer_name` is passed at all is identical to before.
