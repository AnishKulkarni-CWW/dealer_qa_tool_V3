    Given an already-parsed DataFrame with (at least) 'Dealer', 'Region',

    positioned AFTER the named panels column (see the docstring on
    read_dealer_panels_from_excel, which calls this function, for the
    full reasoning on why those extra columns matter and must be read).

    THIS IS THE SINGLE PLACE this column-reading logic lives. Every
    caller that turns a parsed Excel sheet into List[DealerRow] — whether
    from the default auto-detected sheet or from the sidebar's manual
    "Excel Sheet Selection" dropdown — MUST route through this function
    rather than re-implementing its own column mapping. The extra-column
    fix was previously applied only inside read_dealer_panels_from_excel
    itself; the manual-sheet-selection code path in the sidebar had its
    own separate, never-updated copy of the same column-mapping logic,
    so a user who explicitly picked a sheet from that dropdown (rather
    than leaving it on auto-detect) got the OLD, extra-columns-blind
    behaviour even after the fix shipped — confirmed against a real
    session where the sidebar's "Loaded N dealer row(s) from MANUALLY
    SELECTED sheet" message proved that code path was the one that ran.
    Routing both paths through this one function makes that class of
    bug (two implementations silently drifting apart) structurally
    impossible going forward.

    Simulates what a browser actually SHOWS on screen, whitespace-wise —
    used specifically for the double-space check (run_double_space_qa),
    which must only flag a double space a reader would actually see, not
    HTML source-code formatting.

    Per standard HTML whitespace rules (the default white-space: normal,
    which this app's emails all use — no white-space: pre anywhere), a
    browser collapses ANY run of plain whitespace (spaces, tabs,
    newlines) down to exactly one rendered space, no matter how much
    indentation or how many line breaks are in the source. This is why
    an HTML file can be nicely tab-indented for readability — extra tabs
    between "BMW Bird Automotive" and its closing </td>, or inside a long
    indented paragraph — and still render as normal single-spaced text;
    those tabs are invisible to an actual reader and must be invisible to
    this check too.

    The ONE way to force a browser to render more than one consecutive
    visible space is &nbsp; (it does NOT collapse). So a genuine
    double-space authoring bug looks like "word&nbsp;&nbsp;word" or
    "word &nbsp;word" in the source — &nbsp; adjacent to a plain space or
    another &nbsp;. This function keeps &nbsp; as its own distinct
    character (U+00A0) rather than normalizing it to a plain space, so
    the caller can tell "collapsible source formatting" apart from
    "non-collapsible, actually-rendered extra space" — collapsing only
    runs of plain whitespace, never absorbing or collapsing &nbsp; itself.

def find_best_match(source_lines: List[str], target: str) -> Optional[Tuple[int, str]]:
    """
    Finds the source_lines entry that best corresponds to `target`
    (an Excel dealer-panel line), used both to report Present/Missing
    and — via raw_line_text_from_html() — to locate the exact HTML text
    for the stricter case/spacing/format checks.

    Three content types get a DELIBERATELY STRICT, exact check instead of
    fuzzy matching, and — critically — these strict checks run BEFORE the
    loose substring/token-overlap fallback, not as a fallback after it:

    1. Number-bearing targets (phone/landline numbers): only an identical
       digit sequence counts as a match. Token-overlap scoring is unsafe
       here — a wrong number differing only in its last few digits still
       shares most tokens with the correct one (e.g. Excel "...22201" vs
       HTML "...22299" share 3 of 4 tokens) and would otherwise pass.

    2. URL/email-bearing targets (Website:/Email: lines): only an
       identical domain/email counts. Scaffold words ("website", "email",
       the ".com" TLD) are common enough that two completely different
       domains can still share 2+ tokens purely on that scaffolding.

    3. General text (dealer names, addresses, panel prose): NOT given a
       dedicated exact-only block, but the final fallback below still
       discounts panel-wide scaffold words ("bmw", "pvt", "ltd", ...) for
       the same reason — those words alone are not evidence of a match
       between two different dealers.

    These strict checks run BEFORE the loose "is one line a substring of
    the other" shortcut specifically because that shortcut can match a
    bare label fragment — e.g. HTML text "Tel.:" is a substring of target
    "Tel.: +91 82228 22201" — and return on that fragment alone, even
    though the target's actual number is a SEPARATE line elsewhere in the
    HTML. This happens routinely for a correctly hyperlinked Tel./Website
    value, since wrapping it in <a> splits it onto its own text node
    during extraction, separate from its label. A label substring is not
    evidence the real number/domain is present anywhere at all, so for
    these two content types the exact check must be authoritative, not a
    fallback that only runs once the (unsafe, for these shapes) loose
    check has already failed to find anything.

# differences — that fuzziness is the right behaviour for "is this line

# treat "Bird automotive" as identical to "Bird Automotive" or swallow an
# extra/missing space inside the line. This second pass runs only after
# a line has already been located by the fuzzy matcher above, and checks
# that exact HTML text against the Excel cell byte-for-byte (case and
# internal spacing both included).

def raw_line_text_from_html(html_raw: str, source_line: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Returns the HTML's own visible-text rendering of the line that
    corresponds to `source_line` (located the same way compare_source_to_html
    finds it), WITHOUT the lowercasing/whitespace-collapsing that
    normalize_text()/html_to_visible_text() apply for fuzzy matching —
    i.e. exactly as the email actually renders it, casing and internal
    spacing preserved. Returns None if no corresponding line could be
    located at all (already reported as "Missing" by the fuzzy content
    check, so this exact check doesn't need to duplicate that).

    Two-step approach (deliberately does NOT assume the collapsed and raw
    text split into the same number of lines at the same indices, which
    would be a fragile assumption): first locate WHICH line matches using
    the existing robust fuzzy matcher on the collapsed text (so spacing/
    casing anomalies don't prevent the line from being found at all);
    then re-locate that same content directly inside the RAW (uncollapsed)
    text via a regex built from the matched line's own words, tolerant of
    any amount of whitespace between them — this recovers the actual
    as-rendered spacing without relying on the two texts staying index-
    aligned.

    Label reconstruction (number/URL-bearing targets only): a correctly
    built dealer panel wraps the phone number / website / email VALUE in
    its own <a> tag, e.g. `Tel.: <a href="tel:...">+91 82228 22201</a>`.
    HTML text extraction treats the label ("Tel.:") and the linked value
    as separate text nodes/lines, even though they render on the same
    visual line in the email. This is correct, required HTML structure —
    not a bug — so when the target has a label prefix (text before the
    first digit or before the domain/email), this function looks at the
    line immediately preceding the matched value line; if THAT line's
    text is a case-insensitive match for the target's own label portion,
    the two are joined back together (using the target's own spacing)
    so callers doing an exact-match/format comparison are comparing
    against what the email actually, correctly renders as one line —
    not an artifact of DOM text-node boundaries.

      - A capital letter immediately after a dot is treated as a

        treated as a domain by this rule alone).
      - The final dot-separated segment must be letters-only and at
        least 2 characters (a TLD shape: "in", "com" — NOT a number,

    Returns a list of (punct_char, before_char, after_char) for every

    A comma or full stop is only an offence when it is separating two
    WORDS. Three situations look identical to a naive
    "[.,] followed by an alphanumeric" scan but are all perfectly correct
    English, and each is excluded here:

      - Decimal points and thousands separators. A dot or comma sitting
        BETWEEN TWO DIGITS is a number, not a sentence boundary:
        "3.49%*," (an ROI figure), "29,999", "1,10,000", "1.5 Lakh",
        "40,000 kms". This was the cause of the reported false positive:
        the flagged character in "3.49%*," was never the trailing comma
        at all (that comma IS followed by a space in the email) — it was
        the decimal point in "3.49", which the old rule saw as a full
        stop running into the digit "4". Excluding digit-dot-digit and
        digit-comma-digit fixes every number of this shape at once,
        whatever currency symbol, asterisk or percent sign trails it,
        which is why it also covers tokens the old numeric-identifier
        guard missed (that guard required the WHOLE token to be digits
        and separators, so "3.49%*," failed it on the "%" and "*").

      - Initials and abbreviations: a capital immediately either side of
        the dot, e.g. "A.C.", "M.G." — unchanged from before.

      - Domains, URLs, emails and pure numeric identifiers, which are
        filtered out one level up before this function is ever called.

    A real offence still reports: "Plot No.50", "Gate no.3", "Rs.500",
    "sentence.Next" — in every one of those a letter, not a digit, sits
    immediately before the punctuation.
